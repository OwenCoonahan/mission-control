  "fiveYearVision": "I'm 29, living in a penthouse in Manhattan or Santa Monica. Net worth north of $10M. Prospector Labs generates $2M+ ARR — I have a team of 5-10 running it. I've spoken at major energy conferences. My name comes up when people talk about energy data. I'm in the best shape of my life — 210, lean, people ask me what I do. I'm in a relationship with someone incredible who matches my ambition. Mom would be proud. I call my brother every week, see my niece and nephew regularly. I travel when I want, where I want. I wake up excited, not anxious. The scarcity is gone — replaced by abundance in every dimension. I built this from nothing, in Brooklyn, with a Mac mini and a vision.\n\nThe Ferrari 458 is in the garage. Not because I need it — because I earned it.",
