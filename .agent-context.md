# Mission Control Rebuild - Agent Context

## YOUR MISSION
Rebuild Mission Control from scratch as a polished, functional personal dashboard for Owen. The current version has broken UI, disconnected components, and doesn't work properly. You're starting fresh.

## WHAT THIS IS
A personal command center that shows:
- Today's tasks and priorities (with FROG = most important task)
- Goal progress (3 goals: Calm Mind, Grow Business, Greek God Body)
- Activity feed from OpenClaw agent sessions
- Cron job schedule

## TECH STACK
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- File-based JSON storage (simple, no database)
- Dark theme (zinc-950 background, zinc-900 cards)

## DATA LOCATIONS
Tasks and goals are stored in JSON files:
- `/workspace/planning/tasks.json` - task list
- `/workspace/planning/goals.json` - goal progress
- `/workspace/mission-control/data/` - can also store data here

OpenClaw data (read-only):
- `/Users/castle-owencoonahan/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` - scheduled jobs
- `/Users/castle-owencoonahan/.openclaw/agents/cron-runner/sessions/*.jsonl` - session logs

## PAGES TO BUILD

### 1. Dashboard (/)
The home page. Should show:
- Greeting with time of day ("Good morning, Owen")
- Current date/time
- Today's FROG (highlighted, most important task)
- Today's tasks list
- Quick stats (tasks done this week, streak, etc.)
- Goals progress (3 progress bars)
- Recent activity (last few agent actions)

### 2. Tasks (/tasks)
Kanban board with 4 columns:
- Backlog
- Today  
- In Progress
- Done

Each task card shows: title, priority (FROG badge if applicable), goal tag, due date
Click to edit, drag to move (or dropdown to change status)
Add task button with modal form

### 3. Goals (/goals)
3 large goal cards:
- 🧠 Calm Mind (violet)
- 💼 Grow Business (emerald)  
- 💪 Greek God Body (orange)

Each shows:
- Progress bar with percentage
- Target/description
- Related tasks
- Edit button to adjust progress (slider 0-100)

### 4. Activity (/activity)
Two sections:
- Recent Activity: timeline of agent actions from session logs
- Cron Schedule: table of scheduled jobs with next run times

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, modern, dark theme
- Cards should be clearly visible (zinc-900 on zinc-950)
- Violet accent color for active states and CTAs
- Responsive (works on mobile)
- Use shadcn/ui components properly
- NO broken/missing styles

## API ROUTES TO BUILD

- PUT/DELETE /api/tasks/[id] - update and delete tasks
- GET/PUT /api/goals - list and update goals
- GET /api/activity - fetch recent activity from session logs
